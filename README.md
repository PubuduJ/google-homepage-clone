### Responsive design of the Google homepage

The Google.lk homepage was designed to practice and develop my 
web design skills. This website was developed with pure HTML and CSS. 
CSS media queries are used to make the webpage responsive.
Search results for the entered inputs are provided to the user by a 
Google programmable search engine.
